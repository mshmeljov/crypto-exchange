      <p>Bitcoin, introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It gained initial traction among tech enthusiasts and libertarians, establishing itself as a novel form of digital money. Bitcoin's early years were marked by gradual growth and increasing acceptance, culminating in significant price surges and mainstream recognition by 2017.</p>

Today, Bitcoin is seen as both a digital asset akin to "digital gold" and a potential foundation for broader financial innovation, despite ongoing debates about its long-term viability and environmental impact.</p>
